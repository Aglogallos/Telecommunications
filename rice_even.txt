When a broad band of random noise is applied to some physical device, such as an electrical network, the statistical properties of the output are often of interest. For example, when the noise is due to shot effect, its mean and standard deviations are given by Campbell's theorem when the physical device is linear. Additional information of this sort is given by the (auto) correlation function which is a rough measure of the dependence of values of the output separated by a fixed time interval.
