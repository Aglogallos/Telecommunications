The random noise considered is that which arises from shot effect in vacuum tubes or from thermal agitation of electrons in resistors. [...] When a noise voltage or a noise voltage plus a signal is applied to a non-linear device, such as a square-law or linear rectifier, the output will also contain noise. [...] The shot effect in vacuum tubes is a typical example of noise. It is due to fluctuations in the intensity of the stream of electrons flowing from the cathode to the anode.
